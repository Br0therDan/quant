# Phase 4 Plan – MLOps Platform Enablement

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Objective:** Establish durable MLOps capabilities—feature store, model lifecycle management, evaluation harness, and prompt governance—to sustain AI services launched in earlier phases.
- **Business Value:** Ensures reproducibility, compliance, and continuous improvement for AI-driven trading features while enabling scalable collaboration across teams.
- **Timeframe:** 6 weeks (2025-05-12 → 2025-06-20).

## 2. Scope & Deliverables
| ID | Deliverable | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
| -- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| D1 | Feature Store Launch | Version-controlled DuckDB feature views with metadata catalog. | - Feature registry capturing lineage and owners per master plan Section 5.【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L208-L232】<br>- CI checks to validate schema changes<br>- Documentation for feature reuse |
| D2 | Model Lifecycle Management | MLflow/W&B integration with MongoDB metadata sync. | - Experiment tracking templates aligned to Strategy & Backtest models<br>- Deployment checklists covering approval & rollback<br>- Automated drift monitoring alerts |
| D3 | Evaluation Harness | Benchmark suite with explainability artifacts and compliance reports. | - Backtest replay scenarios with baseline comparisons<br>- SHAP/explainability outputs stored alongside results<br>- Review workflow for compliance sign-off |
| D4 | Prompt & Policy Governance | Centralized prompt repository with toxicity/fact-check pipelines. | - Versioned prompt library with approval workflow<br>- Automated evaluation for hallucination/toxicity thresholds<br>- Audit-ready policy documentation |

### Out of Scope
- Additional model development beyond maintaining existing catalog.

## 3. Workstreams & Backlog Mapping
| Workstream | Backlog Items | Notes |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Data Governance | D1 | Extend DuckDB infrastructure leveraging Strategy & Backtest data models.【F:docs/backend/strategy_backtest/ARCHITECTURE.md†L1-L120】 |
| Experimentation & Deployment | D2, D3 | Implement lifecycle tooling supporting ML signal, forecasting, and RL models from earlier phases.【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L13-L132】 |
| Compliance & Governance | D3, D4 | Align evaluation outputs and prompt governance with regulatory expectations per Section 5 guidance.【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L208-L232】 |
| Automation | D1, D2, D4 | Integrate CI/CD workflows ensuring schema, model, and prompt changes trigger automated validation. |

## 4. Milestones
| Milestone | Date | Owner | Exit Criteria |
| --------- | ---- | ----- | ------------- |
| M1: Feature Store Schema Freeze | 2025-05-23 | Data Engineering | Core feature tables published with documentation |
| M2: MLflow/W&B Integration Complete | 2025-06-06 | MLOps Engineer | Experiment tracking and model registry operational |
| M3: Evaluation Harness Pilot | 2025-06-13 | Quant Research | Benchmark report covering two flagship strategies |
| M4: Governance Audit Prep | 2025-06-20 | Compliance | Prompt/policy repository reviewed with audit artifacts |

## 5. Dependencies & Interfaces
- **Phase 1-3 Services:** Need consistent telemetry and metadata to populate feature store and evaluation harness.
- **Infrastructure:** Secure storage for artifacts, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring stack.
- **Compliance Stakeholders:** Provide review cycles and policy inputs for governance deliverables.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Response |
| ---- | ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| Feature version drift | High | Medium | Enforce semantic versioning and automated schema diff checks. |
| Tooling integration complexity (MLflow/W&B) | Medium | Medium | Pilot in sandbox; use uv/ServiceFactory aligned patterns for deployment. |
| Compliance sign-off delays | High | Low | Schedule early reviews; maintain living documentation and audit trails. |

## 7. Metrics & Reporting
- **Feature Store Adoption:** Number of models using shared features, time to provision new feature.
- **Lifecycle Compliance:** Percentage of models with complete metadata, retraining cadence adherence.
- **Evaluation Coverage:** Benchmarks executed per release, percentage with explainability artifacts.
- **Governance Quality:** Prompt approval turnaround time, number of policy violations detected.

## 8. Resource Plan
| Role | Allocation | Notes |
| ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| MLOps Engineer | 1.5 FTE | Feature store automation, MLflow integration |
| Data Engineer | 0.5 FTE | DuckDB schema management |
| Compliance Lead | 0.5 FTE | Governance workflow ownership |
| Backend Engineer | 0.5 FTE | CI/CD integrations, ServiceFactory instrumentation |
| QA Engineer | 0.5 FTE | Automated validation suites |

## 9. Communication Cadence
- Bi-weekly steering review with compliance and executive sponsors.
- Weekly ops sync to track tooling rollout and adoption metrics.

## 10. Exit Criteria
- Feature store, lifecycle tooling, and governance pipelines operational in production.
- Documentation and runbooks handed off to platform operations.
- KPI dashboard updated with platform health metrics and adoption stats.
