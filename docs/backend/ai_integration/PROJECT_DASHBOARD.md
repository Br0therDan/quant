# AI Integration Program Dashboard

## Overview
- **Program Sponsor:** Backend Platform & Quant Research Leads
- **Scope:** Embed machine learning and generative AI capabilities into the FastAPI-based strategy and backtest platform while preserving existing service-factory architecture.
- **Current Focus:** Deliver high-impact predictive intelligence and automated optimization features that leverage the enhanced Strategy & Backtest stack before scaling into generative UX and platform-wide MLOps.

- **M2 â€“ ML Signal API GA (2025-02-14):** Expose probability scores via ServiceFactory and integrate with strategy execution. _Status: On Track_
- **M3 â€“ Optimization API Beta (2025-03-21):** Complete Optuna orchestration and persistence. _Status: At Risk_
- **M4 â€“ Generative Insights MVP (2025-04-25):** Deliver automated narrative reports and conversational builder. _Status: Planned_
- **M5 â€“ MLOps Platform Launch (2025-06-20):** Enable feature store, model registry, evaluation harness. _Status: Planned_

## Key Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| ---- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Compute constraints for RL and forecasting workloads | Delivery delays for Phase 2 RL executor | Medium | Prototype using sampled symbols; plan GPU burst capacity and checkpoint offloading |
| Data drift across Alpha Vantage feeds | Reduces accuracy of ML signals | High | Implement anomaly sentinel and rolling retraining cadence tied to DuckDB refreshes |
| LLM hallucination in narrative reports | Lowers trust in insights | Medium | Enforce structured prompts, Pydantic validation, and fact cross-check against KPI store |
| ServiceFactory coupling complexity | Slows integration of new services | Low | Standardize service registration templates and align with existing Strategy/Backtest architecture |

## Reporting Cadence
- **Standups:** Twice weekly with Strategy & Backtest engineering.
- **Steering Updates:** Bi-weekly slides including KPI deltas and risk log.
- **Artifacts:** Phase plans (see `/docs/backend/ai_integration/phase*`), backlog board synced with this dashboard, architecture diagrams referencing Strategy & Backtest docs.
