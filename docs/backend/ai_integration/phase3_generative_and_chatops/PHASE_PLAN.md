# Phase 3 Plan – Generative Insights & ChatOps

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Objective:** Operationalize generative AI services that translate backtest analytics into executive-ready narratives, enable conversational strategy creation, and deliver ChatOps support for platform diagnostics.
- **Business Value:** Reduces manual analysis time, broadens access to strategy tooling, and improves operational responsiveness through AI-assisted workflows.
- **Timeframe:** 6 weeks (2025-03-31 → 2025-05-09).

## 2. Scope & Deliverables
| ID | Deliverable | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
| -- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| D1 | Narrative Report Service | LLM-driven `ReportGenerationService` producing structured summaries linked to BacktestResult IDs. | - `/backtests/{id}/report` route with caching<br>- Prompts include KPI, regime, signal metadata per master plan Section 4.1【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L133-L159】<br>- Pydantic validation and fact checks |
| D2 | Conversational Strategy Builder | Natural-language interface mapping user intents to StrategyService templates. | - `/strategies/generative-builder` API returning validated configurations per Section 4.2【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L160-L187】<br>- Embedding index covering available indicators<br>- Human-in-the-loop approval workflow |
| D3 | Operations ChatOps Agent | Tool-enabled LLM providing cache, pipeline, and service health diagnostics. | - Slack/FastAPI endpoint enabling tool usage per Section 4.3【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L188-L207】<br>- RBAC enforcement and audit logging<br>- Runbook integration |

### Out of Scope
- Automated production deployment of generated strategies (manual approval remains required).
- Non-text media generation.

## 3. Workstreams & Backlog Mapping
| Workstream | Backlog Items | Notes |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Narrative Intelligence | D1 | Ingest KPI outputs from BacktestService and regime metadata from Phase 1; ensure alignment with Strategy & Backtest data schemas.【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L133-L159】【F:docs/backend/strategy_backtest/ARCHITECTURE.md†L1-L108】 |
| Conversational UX | D2 | Build prompt libraries and embeddings referencing Strategy templates per master plan Section 4.2.【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L160-L187】 |
| ChatOps Enablement | D3 | Register diagnostic tools against MarketDataService and DatabaseManager health checks.【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L188-L207】 |
| Governance & Safety | D1, D2, D3 | Apply guardrails from platform governance (Section 5) for prompt versioning and toxicity checks.【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L208-L232】 |

## 4. Milestones
| Milestone | Date | Owner | Exit Criteria |
| --------- | ---- | ----- | ------------- |
| M1: Prompt & Template Library Complete | 2025-04-11 | Product/UX | Approved prompt catalog with governance controls |
| M2: Narrative MVP Review | 2025-04-18 | Backend | Report service delivering validated outputs for top 5 backtests |
| M3: Conversational Builder Beta | 2025-04-25 | Product | Strategy builder generates configs with <5% validation failure |
| M4: ChatOps Pilot Launch | 2025-05-02 | DevOps | Chat agent answering top 10 operational queries with audit logs |
| M5: Phase Showcase | 2025-05-09 | Product | Executive demo combining narrative, builder, and ChatOps capabilities |

## 5. Dependencies & Interfaces
- **Phase 1 & 2 Outputs:** Access to KPI metrics, regimes, anomaly alerts for prompt enrichment.
- **LLM Providers:** OpenAI/Azure or on-prem models with function calling capability.
- **Authentication & RBAC:** Integration with existing user management to limit tool execution.
- **Monitoring Stack:** Logging and observability pipelines to capture LLM interactions.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Response |
| ---- | ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| LLM hallucination in executive reports | High | Medium | Implement fact-checkers comparing outputs to KPI datastore; enable reviewer approval queue. |
| Prompt drift or governance gaps | Medium | Medium | Version prompts in Git, enforce policy checks per Section 5 guidance.【F:docs/backend/ai_integration/master_plan.md†L208-L232】 |
| Sensitive operations exposed via ChatOps | High | Low | RBAC gating, audit logging, and sandboxed tool execution. |

## 7. Metrics & Reporting
- **Narrative Quality:** Reviewer satisfaction score, factual accuracy rate, turnaround time.
- **Builder Adoption:** Number of generated strategies, approval conversion rate, average revision cycles.
- **ChatOps Usage:** Daily active users, average time-to-resolution, escalations avoided.

## 8. Resource Plan
| Role | Allocation | Notes |
| ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| Backend Engineer | 1 FTE | API integration, caching, RBAC hooks |
| Prompt Engineer | 0.5 FTE | Prompt and guardrail design |
| Product Designer | 0.5 FTE | Conversational UX flows |
| DevOps Engineer | 0.5 FTE | ChatOps deployment, monitoring |
| Compliance Lead | 0.25 FTE | Policy review and audit alignment |

## 9. Communication Cadence
- Weekly content review with Product/Compliance for narrative outputs.
- Bi-weekly demo of ChatOps interactions with DevOps leadership.

## 10. Exit Criteria
- Generative services deployed to staging with rollback plans.
- Governance documentation updated with prompt versions and approval logs.
- Operational playbooks reflect ChatOps escalation paths.
