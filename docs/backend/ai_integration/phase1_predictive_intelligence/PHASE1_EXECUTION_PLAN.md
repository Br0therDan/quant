# Phase 1 Execution Plan – Predictive Intelligence Enablement

This playbook translates the Phase 1 scope into concrete, chronological work packages that engineering, data, and product partners can follow. The steps assume a six-week window (2025-01-06 → 2025-02-14) and align with the deliverables D1–D3 and milestones M1–M4.

## Week 1 – Kickoff and Feature Specification (2025-01-06 → 2025-01-10)
1. **Alignment workshop:** Review the Strategy & Backtest architecture diagram with stakeholders to confirm service integration points for MLSignalService, Regime detection, and probabilistic KPI inference.
2. **Data audit:** Inventory DuckDB tables, MongoDB collections, and Alpha Vantage ingestion coverage. Flag gaps that could block model training.
3. **Feature backlog drafting:** Pair data engineering and quant research to draft candidate feature lists for signals, regime classification, and portfolio forecasting.
4. **Schema & contract updates:** Document DuckDB schema changes and API contract adjustments needed to expose new fields.
5. **Milestone M1 gate:** Secure approval on the feature list and schema updates; capture decisions in project documentation.

## Week 2 – Feature Engineering Foundations (2025-01-13 → 2025-01-17)
1. **DuckDB pipeline implementation:** Build stored procedures or SQL views that materialize rolling indicators, returns, and volatility metrics required for signals and regime labeling.
2. **Job scheduling integration:** Update market data refresh jobs to populate the new features and log pipeline SLAs.
3. **Data quality hooks:** Implement anomaly detection guards (missing data, spikes) to protect feature reliability before model training.
4. **Feature validation session:** Review outputs with quant researchers; iterate on feature windows and normalization strategies.

## Week 3 – Model Development Sprint 1 (2025-01-20 → 2025-01-24)
1. **Signal model training:** Train LightGBM/CatBoost classifiers using engineered features; evaluate accuracy/AUC and SHAP feature contributions.
2. **Regime classifier prototyping:** Experiment with HMM, GMM, or clustering approaches; select the model that best captures market regimes.
3. **Portfolio forecaster baseline:** Train an initial Prophet or TFT model on aggregated portfolio equity curves to produce percentile forecasts.
4. **Artifact management:** Version models using MLflow or joblib; document training datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics.
5. **Milestone M2 gate:** Present cross-validation metrics and secure sign-off to freeze v1 model artifacts.

## Week 4 – Service Integration Sprint 2 (2025-01-27 → 2025-01-31)
1. **ServiceFactory extensions:** Register MLSignalService, RegimeDetectionService, and ProbabilisticKPIService with dependency injection wiring.
2. **API route implementation:** Expose `/signals/{symbol}`, `/market-data/regime`, and portfolio forecast endpoints, returning probabilities, regimes, and percentile bands.
3. **BacktestService orchestration:** Update orchestrator flows so backtests can request signal scores and ingest probabilistic KPI outputs.
4. **Persistence layer updates:** Store regime labels in MongoDB and historical forecast evaluations in DuckDB for later analysis.
5. **Integration review:** Run end-to-end calls across new routes to confirm payload structure and latency budgets.

## Week 5 – Analytics Enablement & Hardening (2025-02-03 → 2025-02-07)
1. **DashboardService enhancements:** Surface regime metadata and probabilistic KPI outputs alongside existing KPIs.
2. **Batch operations:** Configure daily jobs to refresh regime labels and forecast distributions, ensuring repeatable pipelines.
3. **Monitoring instrumentation:** Add logging, metrics, and alerts for model load failures, stale features, and API SLA breaches.
4. **Milestone M3 gate:** Conduct API integration review; validate ServiceFactory registry updates and staging deployment readiness.

## Week 6 – Validation, Demo, and Handoff (2025-02-10 → 2025-02-14)
1. **System QA:** Execute regression tests covering ServiceFactory registration, API contracts, and forecast calibration checks.
2. **Performance validation:** Benchmark inference latency and resource usage; adjust caching or batching strategies if needed.
3. **Documentation & runbooks:** Update feature specs, API schemas, and operational runbooks with final implementation details.
4. **Stakeholder demo:** Showcase BacktestService consuming signal scores and displaying forecast percentiles in the dashboard.
5. **Milestone M4 gate:** Obtain product sign-off and capture lessons learned for Phase 2 planning.

## Cross-Cutting Practices
- **Risk management:** Review data feed gaps and orchestrator integration complexity weekly; apply contingency playbooks as identified in the master plan.
- **Communication cadence:** Maintain weekly sprint reviews with the Strategy & Backtest squad and a mid-phase architecture review.
- **Quality gates:** Ensure each deliverable includes automated tests, ServiceFactory registration checks, and documentation updates before acceptance.
